TIme complexity  - amount of time taken by an algorithm
     -> linear time o(n) - T increases with increase in size of (n) elements

      example

       public static int sumofarray(int [] nums){
              int initial  = 0; //o(1)

              for (int i = 0; i< nums.length;i++){ //o(1)
                  initial += i;  //o(1)
              }

              return initial;  //o(1)

              Total time taken  = o(1) + o(1) + o(1)  + n * o(1)  + o(1)
               =  o(1) + n * o(1)
               find fastest growing term and remeove the coefficient
                  n * o(1)
               remove o(1)

              o(1) + n = o(n)

              o(n)

          }


     -> constant time o(1)  - T remains constant regardles of increase in n


     -> quadratic time o(n power 2) - time increases like a quadratic function
